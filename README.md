# Battleship

This project is a web application version of the classic game [Battleship](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>), created as the final project of The Odin Project's JavaScript course. It focuses on demonstrating skills learned throughout the course, particularly Test Driven Development (TDD) using Jest, which was introduced in the "Testing JavaScript" section. The goal is to apply TDD principles while building the game, reinforcing the concepts covered in the curriculum.
